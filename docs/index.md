# Terraform Testing Provider

The Testing provider creates a basic construct to allow writing basic assertions within Terraform itself rather than offloading the functionality
to an external testing tools and frameworks. Whilst this not currently as extensive as tools such as [Terratest][1], it requires only familiarity
with the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) - the native Terraform language - and thus has a much lower level of entry.

## Example Usage

Terraform 1.0.0 and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    testing = {
      source  = "m13t/testing"
      version = "~> 1.0.0-beta.1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Testing Provider
provider "testing" {
  fail = false
}

# Create a unit test
data "testing_unit" "example" {
  subject = "truth test"

  bool_equal {
    input = true
    expect = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **fail** (Boolean) Whether Terraform should exit with a failure if any assertions fail.
